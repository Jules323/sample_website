	<p>Hello, world!<br>
		It is October 23<sup>rd</sup> of the year 2017.  A rather tragic day it is as I woke to the news that the deadliest mass shooting in USA history occured in Las Vegas, Nevada last nigth - <strong>59 dead and more than 500 injured</strong>.  Tis a dark day indeed.  Prayers for <em>all</em> the families whose lives were irrevocably changed.
