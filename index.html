			Hello, world!<br>
			It is October 23<sup>rd</sup> of the year 2017.  A rather tragic day it is as I woke to the news that the deadliest mass shooting in USA 	history occured in Las Vegas, Nevada last night - <strong>59 dead and more than 500 injured</strong>.  Tis a dark day indeed.  Prayers for 	<em>all</em> the families whose lives were irrevocably changed.

			With that said, I will continue with the exercise:<br><br>
			William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three
  			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>). <br><br>
  			<strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
</p>
	 	<blockquote>
 	 	<p>
    			Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
    			Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
    			Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
    			And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
</p>
